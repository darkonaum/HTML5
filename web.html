		<div class="relative"><h1><b>Cass county deputy surprises grandfather,joins Honor Flight</b></h1>Jake Danielson, 25, of Fargo is a deputy in the volunteer reserve unit of the Cass County Sheriff's Department. When his aunt told him that his grandfather, Gene Estad, would be on the Honor Flight, he signed up to help veterans board the plane, planning to surprise Estad.
		As Estad, a Korean War veteran who lives in Grafton, N.D., walked into Fargo's Hector International Airport, Danielson ran down the steps to meet him.

"Turned around, there he was," Estad recalled Monday, still stunned. "Had no idea he knew about it."

Then, Cass County Sheriff Paul Laney approached Danielson "and asked me if I wanted to go so I could do this with my grandpa," Danielson said. A veteran had canceled, and there was an extra seat on the flight.

	<div class="text2"><h1><b>Oasis says its secured out-of-control North Dakota well</b></h1>More than 67,000 gallons of oil have leaked from the well so far. Law enforcement and federal regulators have closed several roads around the site due to concerns about the effects of leaking gas.

Pumps again began injecting mud and clay into the well, located near a tributary of the Missouri River, at about 8 a.m. local time. Crews had halted operations overnight out of safety concerns.

The well is located about 15 miles south of White Earth, in Mountrail County, one of the more prolific oil-producing regions in North Dakota.

The Houston-based company was first notified that the well had blown out late on Saturday night when a driver passing by the site heard a loud noise and called the company's public emergency response phone line.

Shares of Oasis were up 3.6 percent on Tuesday after earlier rising more than 6 percent in line with the broader markets and a jump in crude oil prices.</div>

	<div class="text3"><h1><b>Wins, not stats matter most for Dubnyk</b></h1>He told himself it was unrealistic to try to compare this season to his remarkable run with the Wild last season, when he posted a .936 save percentage and 1.78 goals-against average in 39 games after being by Minnesota in January.

When questions came to Dubnyk after the Wild suffered their first regulation loss Sunday night, Dubnyk was prepared. Asked about his .887 save percentage through four appearances, he said, “I’m not going to worry about that.”

But considering the Wild believe they signed their goalie of the future to a six-year contract in the summer, the questions are fair. After allowing three or more goals in 10 of 39 games with the Wild last season, Dubnyk has surrendered three or more in three of his first four starts.

“Well, he was undefeated until (Sunday) night,” coach Mike Yeo countered.

After being nominated for the Vezina Trophy last season and placing fourth in MVP voting, Dubnyk is looking for wins, not eyebrow-raising statistics. That means he’s OK with games like Thursday’s, the first of the Wild’s three-game road trip, when they won 4-3 in Arizona.</div>
